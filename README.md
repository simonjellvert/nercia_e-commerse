## About

Nercia is a swedish competence development company that has a turnover of approx SEK 250m and has around 150 employees spread out over 17 offices in Sweden. They're working with both government agencies, municipal education coordinators and private own companies. 
The mission is to both develop skill (through Nercia Utbildning AB/Nercia Training Ltd) and to add skill (through Nercia Bemanning AB/Nercia Staffing Ltd).

Within Nercia Training there is a business area in swedish called "FÃ¶retagsutbildning", in english translated to Business training in which a long lasting strategic orientation has been to develop a webshop where the customers can shop their trainings without having to contact 
a salesperson each and every time they want to book a training for their staff. 

The business area manager, digital training producer and marketing manager has been involved in both lay out of the webshop and what functions they need to be able to launch the website if the board of the company wants the site to go live.

The webshop has a login system so that the user can be able to save billing information and keep track of previuos orders. It has the typical shopping bag function to edit or delete items which has been added. It has a checkout system that provides options for both card payment or by invoice. And of course a card payment system for that option.
Since the products (trainings) are regularly updated with price and new dates it has an easy product managing for the administrators of the site. 


---

## UX

The marketing manager wanted the webshop to look similar to the original website so the visitor would be familiar with the look and to ease the transition from the original page to the webshop. So the first page of the webshop has a obvious welcoming message.

The website follows Nercia's graphical profile which is set up for the all graphical materials to be eye-catching and user friendly.

---

## Target Audience

This webshop is for new and old customers of Nercia and should exist to simplify the booking of the training courses. The purpose is to reduce waitning time for the customer to recieve a confirmation of the booking (which now takes place by a salesperson responding manually), which sometimes can take up till 24 hours. This webshop also allow the customer to ensure that invoicing is set up as preffered and for Nercia's finance department to ensure the invoice is not sent to the wrong adress.

## Business Model

The Business Model is B2C, meaning that the company sells products to customers only.
It focuses on individual transactions only.

---

## Web marketing

in order for this webshop to attract visitors, Nercia's marketing department needs to do a good job with web marketing.

1. Newsletters

Newsletters is implemented in the webshop to target visitors that already have an account registered, and maybe allready have made a purchase on the store.

2. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Nercia.se/)

Facebook is a great tool for webmarketing, although it's not Nercia's primary social media, since the customer of Nercia is business managers.

3. [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nercia1992/)

Instagram is also a great tool for webmarketing but like Facebook it's not Nercia's primary tool.

4. [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@nercia1992?lang=sv-SE)

This social media is on try out at Nercia's marketing department to figure out wheter its a good marketing tool or not.

5. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nercia-utbildning-bemanning/mycompany/)

LinkedIn is the primary marketing tool for Nercia, this is where the target group is and where the target group socialize to get tips and trix to improve their businesses. Nercia's is already doing a great job marketing all their business areas (competence development and competence recruitment). When marketing the trainings under the competence development area it would be easy to link directly to the webshop to make it easier for the interested visitor to place an order. Today, when Nercia is marketing a product on LinkedIn the visitor is facing one or two steps more before there is an accept for a order. This webshop would prevent those those decision makers, who are (often) under a lot of stress or don't have the patience to carry out a few more steps before booking a training, to ignore booking the training.

---

## Future development

#### Link up bookings/order directly to Learning plattform
Nercia has their own learning plattform where the participant get all their info on their training, such as date and time, location, course materials etc. 
When a order has been placed and is valid with participants information (email, name) that info will go straight to the specific training in the learning plattform for the administrators to handle.

#### Link up booking/orders to finance program
When a order has been made and the payment option is invoice the necessary info will automatically be uploaded to the finance program so the finance administrators donÃ¤t have to do extra work.

#### Link up orders directly to CRM system
The orders should automatically be loaded into the CRM database so a salesman can handle incoming orders.

#### Order cancellation
When a order has been placed the user should be able to cancel it and all information about the order will be deleted.

#### Add attendee
The user should be able to add attendees to each product/training.

#### Google map
Tidy up the map on contacts page, missing functionality in the version.

#### Cancel card payments
Implement easy handling for canceling a customers card payment.

#### Resonsive orde management page
In this version the order management is responsive but it doesent look good even though an administrator of this particular page is not likely going to handle orders from the phone or tablet. But for future development that feature is on to do.

#### Obvious redirecting (checkout)
In this version a user that is not authenticated is not able to enter the checkout page, instead it is redirected to the sign up page - but without any messages. It's a bug that should be fixed in the upcoming versions.

#### Google map warning
The Google Map on contacts page works as I expect it do, but get this warning in the browser console: 
"Google Maps
JavaScript API has been leaded directly without leading=async.
This can result in suboptimal performance. For best-practice leading patterns please see: https://goo.gle/js-api-loading"
Next version should have solved this warning.

#### Webhooks for payment
The code is set up but haven't had the time to test it, but will be tested and implemented for next version.

#### Refined file adder
The button for file adding in products and contacts templates does not look so good and should be refined for better UX.

## Agile Methodology

#### GitHub Project Management

I've used GitHubs project management tools for this project to make sure I don't start working on many different to do's at the same time. It have helped me focus on the mission to complete each user story. Although when I got stuck for a longer time with an issue I jumped back to style or make small adjustments on previously finished user stories just to let my mind re-group.

For me it has been a very useful tool and I'm not sure I would have had everything under control if I had to work without it.

I divided the user stories into 6 different mini-projects and tried as best as I could to stick to finish one mini-project at a time.

## Information Architecture

### Database

* During the earliest stages of the project, the database was created using SQLite.
* The database was then migrated to PostgreSQL.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram

The structure of building the model is from the ERD below. The flowchart has been updated since the structure has been updated during the development process.
